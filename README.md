# Shovefall

- Status: Headless gray-box combat implemented; browser gameplay integration pending
- Scope: frontend
- Repository Type: web-app
- Addons: none

Shovefall is a short single-player browser party game about shoving opponents off a collapsing arena. One participant is human and the remaining participants are deterministic rule-based bots. The MVP is a static client application with no backend, database, account system, runtime LLM, or remote analytics.

The repository contains a runnable semantic DOM setup shell, PixiJS WebGL arena preview, exact package graph, and local validation commands. Its renderer-independent 60 Hz simulation now implements mass-sensitive movement, weak circular contact, shove windup/active/recovery, deterministic dodge evasion, missed-shove stumble, same-tick batch impulses, support grace, falling, elimination, stable hashing, and three checked-in replay fixtures. Browser input and rendering integration, bots, collapsing tiles, items, final visual direction, CI, and deployment remain later slices.

## Accepted Toolchain Baseline

- Browser application: semantic HTML, DOM, CSS, and a PixiJS 8 WebGL game world
- Language and type checking: TypeScript 7 stable with `tsc --noEmit` as the authoritative type gate
- Build: Vite 8 with a provider-neutral static `dist` artifact
- Package and automation runtime: Bun stable with a committed `bun.lock`
- Lint: Oxlint with `oxlint-tsgolint@7` type-aware rules
- Format: Oxfmt; no direct Prettier dependency
- Tests: Vitest 4 for unit and simulation scenarios, with Playwright Test for browser smoke and E2E

The complete adoption constraints, rollback path, and version policy are in [docs/engineering/08-toolchain-baseline.md](docs/engineering/08-toolchain-baseline.md).

## Repository Shape Notes

- web-app: This repository type owns routes, rendering mode, browser state, accessibility, and client observability.


## Repository Hygiene

.editorconfig, .gitattributes, and .gitignore are generated to keep line endings,
binary diffs, local files, build outputs, caches, and secret files under control.

## Scope Notes

The toolchain, bootstrap layout, deterministic replay, and first gray-box physics tuning are implemented. The current tuning is an automated-test baseline and still needs visual integration and external playtest evidence before it is treated as fun or final. Static hosting, final visual direction, and the asset inventory remain unimplemented or separately undecided. The grayscale setup surface is not the final art direction.
